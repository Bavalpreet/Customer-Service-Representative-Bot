The facilities or services must provide a public purpose.

In general, the County can assist with the collection of funds for particular improvements such as sidewalks, streetlights, road improvements or maintenance.

Our mosquito control program keeps an up-to-date list of local beekeepers and works with them to protect their hives. If you are a local beekeeper and would like to be added to this list, please contact Clay County Public Works at 284-6335 and request to speak with Mosquito Control.
